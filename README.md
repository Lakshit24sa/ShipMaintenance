🏗️ Application Architecture
🧰 Tech Stack
- Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript
- UI: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (built on Radix UI)
- State Management: React Context API
- Routing: wouter (chosen for its minimal API and small bundle size, ideal for simple projects like this one)
- Forms: react-hook-form + zod
- Storage: localStorage (simulated backend)

🧠 State Management
The app uses React Context API with the following contexts:
- AuthContext – Authentication state
- ShipsContext – Ship data
- ComponentsContext – Component data
- JobsContext – Maintenance job tracking
- NotificationsContext – In-app alerts

🗃️ All state is persisted using localStorage, simulating a backend experience.

⚠️ Known Limitations
- LocalStorage Persistence: Data is browser-bound and unsynced across devices
- Windows Support: May face environment variable issues
-Browser Compatibility: Tested on modern browsers only
- Dropdown Filters: Limited handling of empty values

⚙️ Technical Highlights
✅ Frontend-Only Stack
- No backend required — great for Netlify/Vercel
- Fast setup and lightweight deployment

✅ Context API vs Redux
- Context API offers built-in, dependency-free state management
- Ideal for small/medium-sized apps without Redux complexity

✅ Why shadcn/ui?
- Headless & accessible components
- Customizable with TailwindCSS
- Based on Radix UI primitives for accessibility

✅ Why wouter instead of React Router?
- Lightweight, minimal routing library
- Smaller bundle size — perfect for small dashboards

✅ Role-Based Security
- Simulates a realistic enterprise-level access control system
- UI & route protection based on user roles

🚀 Future Enhancements
- Backend integration with PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- Real-time updates using WebSockets
- File upload support for maintenance reports
- Enhanced filters and analytics dashboard
